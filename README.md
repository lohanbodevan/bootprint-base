### Installing

Fork and clone the repo, then `npm install` to install all dependencies and `npm test` to
ensure all is okay before you start anything.


### Testing

Tests are run with `npm test`. Please ensure all tests are passing before submitting
a pull request (unless you're creating a failing test to increase test coverage or show a problem).

### Code Style

[![standard][standard-image]][standard-url]

This repository uses [`standard`][standard-url] to maintain code style and consistency,
and to avoid style arguments.
```
npm i standard -g
```

It is intentional to don't have `standard`, `istanbul` and `coveralls` in the devDependencies. Travis will handle all that stuffs. That approach will save bandwidth also installing and development time.
